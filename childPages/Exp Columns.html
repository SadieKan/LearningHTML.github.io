        <p>Considered as one of the "big two" publishers in the comic industry, Marvel is a media and entertainment industry owned by Disney.</p>
        <p>
          Founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman, Marvel Comics was originally named Timely Comics. In 1961, the Marvel
          universe was unveiled. In order to comply with the growing requests and interests in superhero books, they
          had commisioned the writer Stan Lee. Stan Lee will eventually write the majority of Marvel's books during that
          time. Eventually movie adaptations of theses comics were made.
